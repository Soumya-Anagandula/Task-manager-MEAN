# Task-manager-MEAN

The project was designed using MEAN Technologies they are MongoDB,Express.js,Angular and Node.js. In this project we can create Tasks and in each Task we can create lists where we can enter an activity which is to be done.After the completion of the activity in a list we can delete it by clicking the delete button or we can strike it by clicking on the list.Each list has two options one to delete and another to edit the list activity.In the same way we can create multiple tasks and can edit the task name as well as delete the task.
